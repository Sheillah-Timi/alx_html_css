# CSS Advanced

Welcome to the **CSS Advanced** project! This project is part of the ALX SE program and focuses on deepening our understanding of CSS and page styling based on an existing Figma design.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply advanced CSS concepts to replicate a web page layout.
- Enhance visual presentation using typography, spacing, alignment, and responsive layouts.
- Follow a Figma design specification with high accuracy.
- Keep the website 100% HTML/CSS/JavaScript based (no external libraries or frameworks).

## 📦 Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main webpage structure.
- `styles/` – Folder to include CSS files (you’ll create this later).
- `images/` – Folder for project images downloaded from Figma (you’ll add them later).

## 🔧 Requirements

- All files must end with a new line.
- Only HTML, CSS, and JS – no NodeJS, React, Bootstrap, etc.
- Code must be W3C compliant and pass the W3C Validator.
- Fonts used must match Figma (download `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT` if missing).
- Follow Figma design layout accurately (rounded values allowed).
